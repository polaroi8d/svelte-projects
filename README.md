<p align="center"><b>Curated list of cool mainly open-source projects created with Svelte/SvelteKit. ⚡️</b></p>

After exploring many excellent projects posted on r/svelte and the Discord Svelte community, I thought it would be a great idea to compile all the projects created by others. This is not a list of awesome components or other resources; it is solely for live production projects, tutorials, and examples that offer solutions to different problems. The main purpose of this repository is to demonstrate what we can achieve with Svelte & SvelteKit, with a focus on open-source projects to assist others in creating their own applications.

New ideas and improvements are welcome.
